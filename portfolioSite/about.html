            <section class="bio">
                <p>I have a great joy in meeting and serving others, and am excited by any opportunity to work as well as take part in the values upheld by my current workplace.</p>
                <p>For my first year and a half at university, I was a volunteer math tutor for the Mathematics Department. Although I was not paid, I came in whenever possible. One reason is that I enjoy meeting new people and helping others to succeed
                    in areas they had once written themselves off as being hopeless cases. Another reason, although not initially known, was that the volunteering position taught and tested me in character values, such as patience, gentleness, understanding,
                    preparation and effective communication of knowledge. Overall, there is a certain humbling quality that comes with being able to foster the growth of others and seeing them succeed. I wish to continue nurturing such character values
                    as well as adding to any positive work environment.</p>
                <p>Besides volunteering, I have a number of experiences regarding family. The family-unit is very important to me and the term extends beyond the immediate reference. I appreciate any company whose staff management is family-oriented and
                    whose employees also share the same point of view. I am curious to find out about what it is like to be a part of any team who focuses on providing the best services or products while maintaining a work environment that fosters employee
                    growth and productivity.</p>
                <p>I am a very adaptive and self-motivated individual. I wish to do whatever task I am appointed to the best of my ability and am more than willing to do more than what is required. I am greatly interested in whom ever communicates their
                    interest in me and would be thrilled to be a valuable asset to whomever I am working for. Thank you for taking the time to read my profile, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
